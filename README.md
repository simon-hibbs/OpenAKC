# OpenAKC

##### Do you have wish you could take control of your SSH trust, stop users from altering or adding trust relationships inside your environment and control when, or how keys can be used?

##### Do you wish you could meet your security teams requirements for identifying which users are accessing role accounts (or even root accounts) without needing to join a directory such as AD or LDAP on every server, with the management overhead that brings?

##### Do you wish your users could manage their own private keys and you didn't need to keep track which personal key grants access where and who owns it?

##### Do you wish you could instantly update or remove a key across an entire estate, without even having to log in to the servers in question?

##### Do you wish you could protect critical system files, or user data from junior sysadmins?

#### OpenAKC provides SSH "Self Service SSH key management for users", "Centralised SSH Key Management for static trust" and can offer advanced features for tracking, auditing and controlling what users (and sysadmins) do.


It a can be used as a stand alone tool or as part of a more advanced "Privilaged Access Management" tool if integrated with a system for approving access, either via a directory such as AD / LDAP or direcetly via the API.

With a client server model, you are free to completely disable local ssh authentication methods your users might leverage to bypass access control!  Confound your troublesome users, or hackers with ssh configuration like this:-

```
AuthorizedKeysFile /dev/null
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
KerberosAuthentication no
GSSAPIAuthentication no
```

Allow users to create and register thier own ssh key pair with the system without involving admin while enforcing the use of pass phrases to encrypt private keys, even segregate security administrators so that they cannot easily grant access to themselves, and not without leaving an audit trail.

Examples:

1. Do you have lots of systems which have a few application accounts, or perhaps just a root account... you don't want to join them all to a directory, and have to deal with maintaining user home folders, and user access control only via a directory that may be run by another team entirely?

2. Do you need to meet security best practice which states that users must log in first with their own account and escalate privilage, but you don't want users to have their own accounts which take up space and need managing?

3. Do you sometimes need to grant privilaged access either to less experienced support staff, or 3rd party support staff and wish you could see exactly what they did (even if the server died as a result).

4. Do you wish you could impose restrictions on exactly when SSH keys could be used to gain access (perhaps to stop access during critical processing), where from... or what users of those keys can do?

5. Do you sometimes have to give "root" access, but wish there was a way to protect certain configuration or settings?


##### OpenAKC is far from a traditional key manager

1. It allows all static trust which would normally be configured in an "authorized_keys" file to be centrally managed.  Public keys are uploaded to the system, and associated with particular hosts/accounts all via an API (or "crontab -e" style rule editor)

2. Logs show exactly which user logged in and from where, even if they logged in directly to a privilaged user.

3. Session recording is achieved (when enabled) via an encrypted stream set up with the security server when an interactive session is opened using OpenAKC authentication.  This allows an almost real time log of the users session.

4. Users can also be presented with a prompt asking them to provide brief details of their reason for access, perhaps a change number etc.

5. Many restrictions applied, over and above what SSH normally provides.  You can provide access within a date range, only on certain days, or at certain times. You can override the users shell, or deny them access to a shell entirely, and even specify what commands they can execute remotely.

6. The option to drop kernel capabilities from the process tree created by a login, will allow you to block certain OS functions from a user, even if they log in as root, use "sudo", or run a "SUID" binary.  Common uses would include, making it impossible to alter immutable files (even for root), or blocking the loading of kernel modules etc.  Details can be found here [Capabilities Man Page][caps]

7. Additional capabilities are added for "scp" functionality, including file transfer logging, and chroot.

You no-longer have to require users to log in to servers with personal accounts and escalate privilages just to ensure complete logging.  OpenAKC relieves you from managing user permissions, home folders, and authentication across large numbers of machines while ensuring detailed records showing which users accessed which servers, and what they did!

WARNING: This is pre-release software and although it is functional, plenty of work remains to ensure it is robust and secure.

Documentation is still being created, but you may like to see an [impromptu demo video][demo].

Any contributions of in regard to documentation, code or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Please note that most of this tool is created using shell code, I hope this makes it approachable for sysadmins (as the likely users), to contribute.
